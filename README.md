# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

```
```
import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
d=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(f"{d:.2f}")
```
